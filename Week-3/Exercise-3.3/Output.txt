log();// What is logged?

------------------------------
Output - Count is 0

We can see createIncrement is called at first and which inturn calls increment() and also sets "message" variable for
the first time i.e "Count is 0 ", and it takes 0 because at the first initialiation the count value is 0 since
increment() function is not invoked yet.
after 3 invokation of the increment(), the count value is incremented, but the log function is never called and
also the message variable value is not changed.
At the end when log() is invoked it prints what is stored in the message variable and i.e the output.
